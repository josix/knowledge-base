- 社群互動後維持關係的 Tips
  - Praise the contributor's work
    - the host, the presenter, the people shared their ideas
  - Ask for the contributor's opinion
    - ask for the contributor's opinion on the topic you are interested in
  - Share the knowledge you have
    - share the slides, the notes, the resources you have so that the participants can find you if possible.
  - Be active to communicate after the event
    - send the message to the participants, ask for the feedback, ask for the next event, ask for the next topic, etc. It's important to show your respect and care for the people.

- LLM 來臨軟體工程師該何去何從
  - 僱傭關係：雇主是否會因為 LLM 的出現而減少對於工程師的需求，對於一位 talent 而言，已經不需要他太多時間去為雇主工作
  - LLM 駕馭了巨大的知識庫和程式撰寫能力堪比好幾位 Jr. Developer 的能力，我們應該思考工程師的價值在哪
    - making decision and take responsibility
      - critical thinking:
        - understand the principles and core-concept and learn how to evaluate the quality and content generated from LLM.
      - decision:
        - technical stacks decision
        - architecture design
        - development experience (if you want to collaborate with LLM)
        - code review
        - feature core value
        - product vision
      - responsibility:
        - making decision has the risk, you need to take the responsibility for the decision you made
        - on-call
        - manage the developers
        - allocate the resources
        - communicate with the stakeholders
