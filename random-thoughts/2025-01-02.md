- Nix 初探
  - Installation - https://nix.dev/install-nix
    - `sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install)`
    - What it does:
      - Install Nix package manager
      - Create a new profile for the current user
      - Add the Nix profile to the user's shell profile
      - Based on the installation log, here are the critical changes Nix made to your machine:
        - File System Changes: (this is because macOS now (starting in 10.15 Catalina) has a read-only root directory. To support Nix, it will create a volume and configure macOS to mount it at /nix)
          Created a dedicated encrypted volume called "Nix Store" mounted at `/nix`
          Modified `/etc/synthetic.conf` to create the mount point
          Modified `/etc/fstab` to specify volume mount options
        - User and Group Creation:
          Created a system group called `nixbld` with GID 350
          Created 32 system users (_nixbld1 through _nixbld32) with UIDs 351-382
          All build users are:
            Set to have /var/empty as home directory
            Disabled from logging in
            Added to the nixbld group
            Hidden from the system
        - Directory Structure:
          Created several directories under /nix, including:
          `install: mkdir /nix/var`
          `install: mkdir /nix/var/log`
          `install: mkdir /nix/var/log/nix`
          `install: mkdir /nix/var/log/nix/drvs`
          `install: mkdir /nix/var/nix`
          `install: mkdir /nix/var/nix/db`
          `install: mkdir /nix/var/nix/gcroots`
          `install: mkdir /nix/var/nix/profiles`
          `install: mkdir /nix/var/nix/temproots`
          `install: mkdir /nix/var/nix/userpool`
          `install: mkdir /nix/var/nix/daemon-socket`
          `install: mkdir /nix/var/nix/gcroots/per-user`
          `install: mkdir /nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user`
          `install: mkdir /nix/store`
          `install: mkdir /etc/nix`
        - Shell Configuration:
          Backed up and modified shell configuration files:
          `/etc/bashrc`
          `/etc/zshrc`
          Added Fish shell configurations
          Added Nix environment setup scripts to these files (e.g. execute `. '/nix/var/nix/profiles/default/etc/profile.d/nix-daemon.sh'`)
        - System Services:
          Created a LaunchDaemon at /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.nixos.nix-daemon.plist
          Set up a service to automatically mount the Nix volume
        - Package Management:
          Installed Nix package manager under `/nix/store/`
          Set up the default profile with basic packages including SSL certificates (nss-cacert)

          These changes make Nix work as a separate package manager on macOS, isolated from the rest of your system in its own volume.
  - Usage
    - `nix-shell -p <package>`: Start a shell with the specified package available
    - `nix-shell -p <package> --command <command>`: Run a command in a shell with the specified package available
    - `nix-shell -p <package> --run <command>`: Run a command in a shell with the specified package available and exit
    - `nix-store --gc`: Garbage collect the Nix store to remove unused packages
