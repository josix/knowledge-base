# Kafka Architecture and Implementation Deep Dive

## Core Architecture Components
- ZooKeeper/KRaft: Cluster coordination and management
- Controller: Broker state and partition management 
- Broker Cluster: Data storage and transmission
- Topics & Partitions: Logical data organization
- Producers & Consumers: Client interfaces

## Data Flow Patterns
- Producer → Broker → Consumer unidirectional flow
- Support for multiple concurrent producers and consumers
- Partition-based parallel processing
- Leader-Follower replication model
- Zero-copy data transfer optimization

## Implementation Details

### Controller and Coordination Service
- Controller election via ZooKeeper/KRaft
- State storage and monitoring
- Broker health tracking
- Partition leadership management
- Failure detection and recovery

### Consumer Implementation
- Polling mechanism
- Fetch request/response cycle 
- Record processing and deserialization
- Offset management
- Consumer group coordination

### Node Management
- Node vs Broker distinction
- Connection state tracking
- Session handling
- Network client implementation
- Failure handling and backoff

### Migration to KRaft
- Removal of ZooKeeper dependency
- Controller-broker integration
- Metadata storage changes
- Configuration differences
- Deployment simplification
