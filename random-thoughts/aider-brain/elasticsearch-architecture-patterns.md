# Elasticsearch Architecture Patterns

## Core Concepts

### Distributed Architecture
- Cluster organization and node types
- Sharding and replication strategies
- Master node election process
- Coordination node responsibilities

### Data Organization
- Index structure and management
- Document storage and retrieval
- Mapping and type systems
- Analysis and tokenization

### Search Mechanics
- Query DSL fundamentals
- Relevance scoring
- Full-text search capabilities
- Aggregation framework

## Implementation Patterns

### Indexing Strategies
- Bulk indexing optimization
- Refresh interval tuning
- Index lifecycle management
- Aliasing patterns

### Query Optimization
- Query planning and execution
- Filter vs. query context
- Caching mechanisms
- Performance tuning

### Scaling Patterns
- Horizontal scaling approaches
- Cross-cluster replication
- Hot-warm architecture
- Resource allocation

## Best Practices

### Performance Optimization
- Memory management
- Garbage collection tuning
- Circuit breaker configuration
- Bulk operation sizing

### Reliability
- Backup and recovery
- Cluster state management
- Split-brain prevention
- Monitoring and alerting

### Security
- Authentication methods
- Authorization models
- Network security
- Audit logging

## Advanced Topics

### Machine Learning
- Anomaly detection
- Forecasting capabilities
- Feature engineering
- Model deployment

### Search Relevance
- Boosting strategies
- Custom scoring
- Synonyms and analyzers
- Query rewriting

### Operations
- Cluster maintenance
- Rolling upgrades
- Disaster recovery
- Capacity planning
