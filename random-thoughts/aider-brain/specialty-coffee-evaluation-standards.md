# Specialty Coffee Evaluation Standards

## Cupping Protocol (BH Standards)

### Pre-Cupping Setup
- Sample limit: Maximum 12 coffee samples
- Equipment needed: 150-200ml cupping bowls (2-6 bowls per sample)
- Ratio: 55g/L (10g coffee per bowl)
- Grinder setup: Calibrated for >20% extraction at 8 minutes
- Weight precision: +/- 0.1g per bowl

### Water Parameters
- Temperature: Just off boil
- pH: 7.0-7.4
- Buffer: <70 ppm
- Volume: 150-200ml (±2g precision)

### Tasting Process
1. Pour water at consistent speed (≈3 bowls/minute)
2. Break crust at 5 minutes, stir 4 times
3. Clean surface immediately after breaking
4. Sample 5ml at 8 minutes for TDS measurement
5. Begin evaluation below 65°C

### Temperature Stages
- Hot: 65°C (Initial tasting)
- Comfortable: 55°C (Peak aromatics)
- Warm: 45°C (Minimum evaluation temperature)

## Sensory Evaluation Criteria

### Primary Attributes
1. **Aroma**
   - Includes dry fragrance and wet aroma
   - Evaluate intensity, complexity, and quality
   - Influenced by molecular polarity and volatility

2. **Flavor**
   - Combined taste and retronasal aroma
   - Focus on sweet and acid notes
   - Evaluate below 71°C

3. **Aftertaste**
   - Post-swallow flavor persistence
   - Lower volatility compounds
   - Duration: seconds to minutes

4. **Acidity**
   - Quality over intensity
   - Positive: refined, bright, fruited
   - Negative: sharp, flat, sour
   - Related to titratable acidity

5. **Sweetness**
   - Aromatic sweetness contribution
   - Intensity and quality evaluation
   - Peak sensitivity near body temperature

### Texture Attributes
1. **Weight**
   - Viscosity and richness
   - Mouthfeel correlation
   - Particle size influence

2. **Texture**
   - Density, viscosity, surface tension
   - Smoothness vs. astringency
   - Oil content effects

3. **Afterfeel**
   - Residual tactile sensations
   - Duration up to 15 minutes
   - Clean, refreshing finish preferred

### Overall Assessment
1. **Balance**
   - Harmony of all sensory elements
   - Entry to finish coherence
   - Tactile experience integration

2. **Scoring System**
   - Above 8.0: Minimal negative attributes
   - Below 8.0: Presence of defects
   - Below 7.5: Automatic disqualification
