## Aider Introduction Core Concepts

Here is the core concepts, and the basic ideas behind Aider I will be discussing in this presentation.

### Aider

- How to install Aider 
  - [https://aider.chat/docs/install.html](https://aider.chat/docs/install.html)`
- How to use Aider 
  - [https://aider.chat/docs/usage.html](https://aider.chat/docs/usage.html)
  - [https://aider.chat/docs/usage/commands.html](https://aider.chat/docs/usage/commands.html)
  - [https://aider.chat/docs/usage/watch.html](https://aider.chat/docs/usage/watch.html)
- How to apply Aider in your projects/daily life

### Aider Core Concepts

- What is Repo Map and how Aider leverages it? How Aider leverages Concrete Syntax Tree (CST)
- How Aider build prompts in the custom way (diff mode, etc.)
- How Aider is designed as-is to be used with LLM
  - Aider come up with the idea of Repo Map and CST to do the better retrieval of the code
  - Aider designed its prompt templates to be used with LLM in a good way

### Experience with Aider

- [[2024-11-15]]
- [[2024-11-19]]

- For designing LLM applications, we should focus on the following aspects:
  - How to design the prompt templates
  - How to design the retrieval of the codebase with better information quality
  - Choose the right LLM model

### Do's and Don'ts with Aider

- [https://aider.chat/docs/usage/tips.html](https://aider.chat/docs/usage/tips.)html
- Add the required-only files to the Aider workspace
- Ask the right questions, get the right answers; give the right commands, get the right results
  - If you knows what/where resources is helpful for you, add them to the prompts.
- Aider is doing well for code understanding, documentation, and code maintenance
- Aider is lightweight (no dependencies to IDE, no language server required), flexible, and powerful, we should build the LLM applications based on Aider's design principles

- Don't treat Aider as a search engine
  - Aider is not a search engine, it is more like a domain expert/QA system for your codebase. You should ask the right questions to get the right answers.
  - Don't ask Aider for the things it doesn't know
- Don't trust Aider blindly if you have no idea what you are asking
  - If you have no idea, ask Aider for help but don't trust it blindly. You should verify the answers by yourself and go back to the point 1.

### What Human Can Do

- We are not typing machines anymore, we are thinking machines. We should focus on the high-level thinking and let the machine do the typing work.
  - Pay attention to the solution trade-off, making great decisions
  - Deliver the high-quality code, documentation, and design, helping the knowledge transfer effectively (if you use Aider correctly, it will help you to do this)
- We should contribute our ideas/knowledge to the machine in structured format, and let the machine help us to retrieve the information we need
