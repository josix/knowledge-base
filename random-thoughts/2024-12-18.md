- From Core Vision to MVP through LLM
  - Need to specify the vision
  - Need to add more concepts specific domains like SEO, etc.
  - Need to specify the Tech Stacks
  - Need to specify the PRD
  - Need to specify the Interface in detail
- Windsurf seems to provide an excellent way to manipulate agents in IDE
  - PR, Issue, Merge, through gh CLI

  - New Use Mindset
    - Discuss with LLM first to see the the things I don't know. LLM has actually decrease the barrier of different domains of knowledge, we can actually leverage it to kickoff the design. Even the prompt could generated from LLM.
      - 這其實是有實際發生在開發流程的，在編輯器中的透過 copilot 補全了一部分段落，而後又由 LLM tool 產生了更多內容。（在 Aider 的 watch-mode 中， copilot 產生想要執行 AI! 的補全，因此這其實是 prompt to prompt 然後完成任務的實踐）
    - If you don't have an example, steal one from the internet.

- LLM observations
  - API Rate Limits seems to be a problem when we are heavily using LLM tools, so people tend to use multiple LLM based tools and switch between them. 
  - Business isn’t really caring about how the product or code is generated, as long as the product is useful, eyes catching enough then it’s a good way to make it. However, it might not be a good way to run it long term. The needs change everyday so the product should change rapidly according to the user feedback. We still need to figure out how to interact with LLM the right way to achieve it.
  - The LLM tools seems to forget the mobile environment, many tools are not supporting the Xcode, Android Studio, etc. XD
  - As freelancers or engineering consultants products are mostly one-off, which would rely heavily on chat to complete coding tasks without touching the code.
  - Therefore, Windsurf's cascade flow enables them to cooperate seamlessly with AI, as AI in chat knows user’s edits and can continue what user has done in chats.
  - Team leads found it is difficult to introduce Windsurf / Cursor / Aider chat capability to their team members. Team members often do not know how to properly instruct the AI agent to complete tasks.

  - Found New Tools - bolt.new, Google Studio AI, Windsurf
