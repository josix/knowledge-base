## Cloud and Cloud Native Basics

### Cloud
- Definition
    - An IT environment that is designed for the purpose of remotely provisioning scalable and measured IT resources.
    - Five essential characteristics
        - On-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, measured service (details later)
    - Three service models
        - SaaS, PaaS, IaaS
    - Four deployment models
        - Private Cloud, Community Cloud, Public Cloud, Hybrid Cloud

- Resource
    - physical server
    - virtual server
    - software programs
    - service
    - storage device
    - network device
### Cloud: Essential Characteristics
- Rapid elasticity
    -  隨需伸縮，而且要夠快!
- Resource pooling (Multi-tenant)
    -  多租戶 (details are in the next few slides)
- On-demand self-service
    -  可以在要的時候再即時取得資源，而且過程高度自動化，可以由使用者即時線上申請
- Broad network access
    -  透過既有標準協定(如HTTP)，隨時隨地可存取此服務
- Measured service
    -  Pay per use
